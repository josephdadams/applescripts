# applescripts
Various AppleScripts I've created to help automate certain processes.

**Drive Space Check**
Checks the space of the volume(s) you specify and sends an alert to you via a Slack Webhook when a percentage threshhold of capacity remains.
Use in conjunction with the .plist file to schedule it with the launchd process to run on a regular basis.
